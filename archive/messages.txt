(2) Word/Phrase -- English version of the word or phrase to be translated

Note: A phrase may include 'placeholders', which are strings enclosed within
dollar sign symbols ('$'). Please translate all of the text in the phrase,
including punctuation, but without modifying the placeholders, as they will
be replaced with content from the web page.

Please return this file as a plain text file.

Thank you in advance! Your help is greatly appreciated.
