## Description

The `SkipTo Landmarks & Headings` browser extension for Firefox and Chrome provides keyboard access to the landmark regions and headings (h1â€“h6) on a web page.

When the `SkipTo` menu is opened, it displays a list of landmark regions and headings based on the content of the page currently loaded in the active tab of the browser and on the extension's configuration settings.

When a menu item is activated, the `popup` window is closed and the extension sets focus to the selected element and scrolls it into view, in effect, allowing you to "skip to" the selected content.

The `SkipTo` menu, which is keyboard navigable, also provides an outline of the major sections and topics on a web page, making it easier for people to understand and find content on well-structured pages.
