# SkipTo Extension

## Description

The `SkipTo` browser extension for Firefox and Chrome provides keyboard
access to the landmark regions and headings (H1â€“H6) on a web page.

When the `SkipTo` menu is opened, it displays a list of landmark regions and
headings based on the content of the page currently loaded in the active tab
of the browser and on the extension's configuration settings.

When a menu item is activated, the `popup` window is closed and the extension
sets focus to the selected element and scrolls it into view, in effect,
allowing you to "skip to" the selected content.

The `SkipTo` menu, which is keyboard navigable, also provides an outline of
the major sections and topics on a web page, making it easier for people to
understand and find content on well-structured pages.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

To open the `SkipTo` menu via the keyboard, use `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + K`. Focus
is set to the first menu item.

Once the menu is displayed and has focus, you can move through the menu items
via the following keystrokes:

* `arrow down`, `arrow up`: step through the items one at a time
* `page down`, `page up`: move eight items forward or backward
* `home`, `end`: move to first or last item
* `m`: next `main` landmark
* `n`: next `navigation` landmark
* `s`: next `search` landmark
* `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`: next heading of that level
  (e.g. `2` -> go to next `H2`)

#### To activate a menu item
* If the menu item has focus, press `enter` or `space`, or
* `click` any menu item with the mouse.

#### To close the menu without activating a menu item
* Press `tab` or `escape`, or
* `click` the `SkipTo` toolbar button, or
* `click` somewhere outside of the popup window.
