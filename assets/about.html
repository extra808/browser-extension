<h2>Overview</h2>

‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’ extends the web browser by providing easy navigation to the ARIA landmark regions and HTML section headings (h1–h6) of a web page.

The keyboard shortcut for opening the ‘Skip To’ menu is ‘ALT+2’ (‘OPTION+2’ on Macintosh) and cursors keys can be used to navigate the menu (see ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ below). Activating a menu item (1) closes the menu, (2) scrolls the corresponding landmark region or heading element into view and (3) moves keyboard focus to it on the page.

The menu is divided into two separate groups of menu items: (1) ‘Landmarks’: the important landmark regions and (2) ‘Headings’: an outline of the heading structure found on the page.

The ‘Landmarks’ section of the menu may include the following landmarks (definitions are from the WAI-ARIA 1.3 specification):
<ul>
  <li>‘Main’: the main content of a document</li>
  <li>‘Search’: a collection of items and objects that combine to create a search facility</li>
  <li>‘Navigation’: a collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents</li>
  <li>‘Complementary’: content that is designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remaining meaningful when separated from the main content</li>
  <li>‘Contentinfo’: information about the parent document</li>
</ul>

The ‘Headings’ section of the menu can be configured in ‘Options/Preferences’ to only include headings up to a maximum heading level. For example, a maximum level of 3 (the default) only displays headings with levels 1–3.

‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’ provides a means for people using the keyboard to efficiently navigate to specific content on the page. The outline of headings provides an easy way for people to view the topics on a web page without having to scroll through the entire page.
