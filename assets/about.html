<h2>Overview</h2>

‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’ extends the web browser by identifying and providing navigation to the ARIA landmark regions and HTML section headings (h1–h6) of a web page.

The keyboard shortcut for opening the menu is ‘alt+2’ (‘option+2’ on Macintosh) and cursors keys can be used to navigate the menu (see ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ below). Activating a menu item (1) closes the menu, (2) scrolls the corresponding landmark region or heading element into view and (3) moves keyboard focus to it on the page.

The menu is divided into two separate groupings: (1) ‘Landmarks’: the important landmark regions and (2) ‘Headings’: an outline of the heading structure found on the page.

The ‘Landmarks’ section of the menu may include the following (definitions are from the WAI-ARIA 1.3 specification):
<ul>
  <li>‘Main’: the main content of a document</li>
  <li>‘Search’: a collection of items and objects that combine to create a search facility</li>
  <li>‘Navigation’: a collection of navigational elements (usually links) for navigating the document or related documents</li>
  <li>‘Complementary’: content that is designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM hierarchy, but remaining meaningful when separated from the main content</li>
  <li>‘Contentinfo’: information about the parent document</li>
</ul>

The ‘Headings’ section of the menu can be configured (see ‘Options/Preferences’ below) to only display headings up to a maximum depth of heading level (for example, maximum depth of 3 would only display heading levels 1–3).

‘Skip to Landmarks and Headings’ provides a means for people using the keyboard to efficiently navigate to specific content on the page. The outline of headings provides an easy way for people to view the topics on a web page without having to scroll through the entire page.

<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

To open the ‘Skip To’ menu using the keyboard, press ‘alt+2’ (‘option+2’ on macOS).

You can move through the menu items by pressing the following keys:

<ul>
  <li>‘arrow down’, ‘arrow up’: step through the items one at a time</li>
  <li>‘page down’, ‘page up’: move eight items forward or backward</li>
  <li>‘home’, ‘end’: move to first or last item</li>
  <li>‘m’: ‘main’ landmark</li>
  <li>‘n’: next ‘navigation’ landmark</li>
  <li>‘s’: next ‘search’ landmark</li>
  <li>‘a’: next ‘complementary’ landmark</li>
  <li>‘c’: next ‘contentinfo’ landmark</li>
  <li>‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, ‘5’, ‘6’: next heading of that level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Options/Preferences</h2>

<h3>Landmarks</h3>

By default, ‘Skip To’ displays ‘main’, ‘search’, ‘navigation’ and ‘contentinfo’ landmarks when found on the page. In addition to these, the ‘Skip To’ Preferences form provides an option for toggling on or off the inclusion of ‘complementary’ landmarks.

<h3>Headings</h3>

The Preferences form provides a means for selecting the maximum depth of heading levels used to create the headings outline. The benefit of limiting the maximum depth is to make the outline shorter and easier to scan for topics of interest.

Also in Preferences is an option for choosing whether heading level numbers are displayed. When this option is toggled ’on’, the heading level number is added as a prefix to the heading menu items.

Additionally, there is an option to limit the list of headings to only those contained within the ‘main’ landmark region. In well structured pages, the ‘main’ region contains the most important information on the page; limiting headings to the ‘main’ region makes it easier to identify topics of interest by filtering out headings in other parts of the page.
