Description:

<b>Overview</b>

SkipTo Landmarks & Headings extends the web browser by providing a menu for easy navigation to the ARIA landmark regions and HTML section headings of a web page.

The keyboard shortcut for opening the menu is <b>alt+2</b> (<b>option+2</b> on Mac keyboards) and cursors keys can be used to navigate the menu.

Activating a menu item scrolls the corresponding landmark region or heading element into view and moves keyboard focus to it on the page.

Complete documentation on keyboard shortcuts, options/preferences and more is available at the <a href="https://skipto.github.io/">SkipTo Documentation</a> website.
